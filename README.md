 The repository offers the SimNet (an interactive simulator that generates a Synthetic Data Ecosystem for Mobile Communication Networks) along with the Synthetic Data (including the user data, the wireless environment data, and the network performance data).

Welcome to the SimNet Repository

SimNet is an interactive simulator designed to generate a Synthetic Data Ecosystem for Mobile Communication Networks. This repository provides both the SimNet simulator itself and a comprehensive collection of synthetic data, which includes:

- User Data: Simulated user profiles, behaviors, and preferences for realistic mobile network scenarios.
- Wireless Environment Data: Detailed information on signal strengths, interference, and network topology.
- Network Performance Data: Metrics and statistics related to network performance, including latency, throughput, and packet loss.

Key Features:
- SimNet Simulator: A user-friendly, interactive simulator for generating synthetic data ecosystems, allowing researchers and developers to emulate mobile communication networks.
- Versatile Data Sets: High-quality synthetic data sets that can be used for various research, testing, and training purposes in the field of mobile networks.
- Open Source: SimNet and the synthetic data are open-source and freely available for academic, research, and development purposes.

Usage:
1. Clone or download this repository to access the SimNet simulator and synthetic data.
2. Refer to the provided documentation for instructions on using the simulator and integrating the synthetic data into your projects.
3. Contribute: Feel free to contribute to the development of SimNet or share your research findings using the synthetic data. We welcome collaboration from the community.
